- sandboxing the compiler (the TeX \def\a{\a}\a causes an infinite loop, and the page hangs)
- provide a nice way for people to contribute/share templates (maybe read them from homedir via certs..?)
- have it save a temp file automatically every so often
- add more templates
- highlight errors
- possibly provide a math-image service?
- word count
- possibly integrate with detexify?
- fix the bug where text that is too long wraps only as a gray shadow

LaTeX <---> HTML conversion
- improve the connection between the WYSIWYG editor and the source editor (and move the connection to the master branch, when it's good enough)
- make the conversion math-aware (TinyMCE does math in a special way; we need to patch the conversion to do this) (ask jgross for details on this)
- make HyperLaTeX work
- find more LaTeX to HTML converters, or HTML to LaTeX converters, install them/get them working, and include them in the website (ask jgross for details on the current method of inclusion)
- "synchronize" conversion, so that updating a part of the document in the WYSIWYG only updates the corresponding TeX code, and does not regenerate the entire document (jgross has some ideas for this)
