- sandboxing the compiler (I bet you could easily get it in an infinte loop right now)
- provide a nice way for people to contribute/share templates (maybe read them from homedir via certs..?)
- have it save a temp file automatically every so often
- connect the WYSIWYG editor to the source editor
- add math to the WYSIWYG editor (e.g. http://www.imathas.com/editordemo/demo.html)
- add more templates
- highlight errors
- possibly provide a math-image service?
- word count
- possibly integrate with detexify?
- possibly allow modification of the documentclass and options
